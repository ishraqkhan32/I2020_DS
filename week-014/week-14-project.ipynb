    "For this project I have two ideas in mind. The first idea is extending my Phase 1 project, but this time incorporating Covid-19 data to draw connections between gym capacity in an area and rising covid cases. My data would be split into two different datasets: 1) blink gym capacity data that is automatically scraped by me and 2) covid-19 cases from Open Data sources. I would start off looking specifically at cases within NYC to keep the scope of my project small.\n",

    "For my second idea, I'd want to analyze the Data Science chat logs from our Zoom sessions. There are a few problems with this idea. The first is privacy: some students may not want chat logs to be analyzed. Another problem is access. According to Nickala, the logs are available but it would take a bit of time for her to gather them all for me. The data would then need to be clean, parsed, and formatted which is a process that I have never gone through for natural language data sources. Lastly is the lack of a clear goal for my project. One idea is sentiment analysis and change in student confidence over time. I'd imagine using a lot of external libraries for the project to accomplish that goal. "
